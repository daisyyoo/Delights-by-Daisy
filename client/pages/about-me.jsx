            Hi! I&apos;m Daisy, and I love food. I love food so much I wanted to make a career out of it and went to The Culinary Institue of America for cooking, not baking. I donâ€™t have a sweet tooth like most. But when I decide to indulge in something sweet, my favorite is a chocolate chip cookie.

            As you can assume, I am very picky about my cookie. I never found one I loved, not too sweet, crunchy edges, chewy center, LOTS of good quality chocolate and all those beautiful cracks that add beauty and texture. So during covid, I decided to make my own version. After perfecting what I think is the perfect chocolate chip cookie, I made different flavors and variations. I hope my cookie research gives you a moment of delight.
