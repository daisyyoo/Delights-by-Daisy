  'Chocolate Chip',
  '400',
  '3.5',
  'This is my ideal chocolate chip cookie: crunchy edges, chewy center and lots of high quality chocolate with just enough sweetness to enjoy the cookie.',
  'flour, granulated sugar, brown sugar, eggs, butter, vanilla, salt, baking soda, baking powder, dark chocolate, milk chocolate',
  'gluten, egg, dairy',
  'During covid, I had a lot of time on my hands and craved chocolate chip cookies. I am very picky when it comes to chocolate cookies though. Many sold commercially are usually too sweet that it gives me a headache and I cannot finish the whole cookie. So with ample time and no place to go, I decided to make my own recipe. With lots of high quality chocolate and plenty of resting time, this is my version of what a chocolate chip cookie should be. I like to call it lots of high quality chocolate with a side of cookie.',

  'White Chocolate Cranberry',
  '400',
  '3.5',
  'This is the most unadulterated cookie I make. I let the ingredients speak for themselves without the batter overpowering their natural sweetness. If you prefer natural sweetness and trail mix-like flavors, you''ll love this one.',
  'flour, granulated sugar, brown sugar, eggs, butter, vanilla, salt, baking soda, baking powder, white chocolate, dried cranberries, walnut pieces',
  'gluten, egg, dairy, tree nut',
  'This is my mom''s favorite cookie and that''s saying a lot because she does not like cookies. I made this one inspired by the flavor of asian sweets. Asian sweets always have some kind of nut, and use dried fruit for their natural sweetness. The white chocolate adds a bit more sweetness so you can still indulge in a cookie.',

  'Snickerdoodle',
  '400',
  '3.5',
  'I love snickerdoodle cookies. Who doesn''t love the flavor of sugar and cinnamon? I made them larger than typical so I could get the crispy outsides while retaining the famous soft fluffy center.',
  'flour, granulated sugar, eggs, butter, vanilla, salt, baking soda, cream of tartar, ground cinnamon',
  'gluten, egg, dairy',
  'I don''t find many shops that actually sell snickerdoodle flavor cookies. I honestly don''t know why. But I fell in love with this flavor this one time my mom bought cookie dough boxes for a someone''s kid''s fundraiser back in high school. I think I ended up baking and eating most of the box by myself.',

  'Jasmine Almond Blueberry',
  '400',
  '3.5',
  'These are probably my all-time favorite creation. The light fragrance of jasmine tea leaves are enhanced with the white chocolate, dried blueberries and almond slivers acting in perfect harmony.',
  'flour, granulated sugar, brown sugar, eggs, butter, vanilla, salt, baking soda, baking powder, white chocolate, jasming tea, dried bluerries, almond slices',
  'gluten, egg, dairy, tree nut',
  'This is my homage to my favorite boba drink flavor which is jasmine milk tea. This is inspired by a tea snack you would eat during a Chinese Tea Ceremony. If you love jasmine tea, you need to try this. Trust me, you''ll thank me later.',

  'Earl Grey Blueberry',

  'flour, granulated sugar, brown sugar, eggs, butter, vanilla, salt, baking soda, baking powder, earl grey tea, dried blueberries, white chocolate, orange zest',
  'gluten, egg, dairy',
  'This is the result of a pleasant mistake. I had a batch of orange zest cookie dough that was too wet and a batch of earl grey dough that was too dry. I ended up test baking them together and to my pleasant surprise, they balanced each other out perfectly. Thus this cookie was born.',

  'Chocolate Peanut Butter',
  '400',
