  'During covid, I had a lot of time on my hands and craved chocolate chip cookies. I am very picky when it comes to chocolate cookies though. Many sold commercially are usually too sweet that it gives me a headache and I cannot finish the whole cookie. So with ample time and no place to go, I decided to make my own recipe. With lots of high quality chocolate and plenty of resting time, this is my version of what a chocolate chip cookie should be. I like to call it lots of high quality chocolate with a side of cookie.'
